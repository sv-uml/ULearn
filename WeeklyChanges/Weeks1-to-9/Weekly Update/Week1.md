# Weekly Progress Report - Week 1
The first week was spent trying to find a major pain point to solve. A range of problems - from HR management software to CRM systems - were considered. The final result was a Learning Management System (LMS) for companies.

## Thoughts
Building an LMS software is not difficult. Prior experience with such systems (Moodle, Blackboard) helps in prioritizing features and building a good user experience. Initial plans include (as of now):
- User management (Manage users within organization)
- Ability to add a video-based or text-based training course
- Post-training quiz/exams

## Struggle/Problems
Although no technical issues were encountered, it was difficult to find a problem that didn't already have a powerful solution. For example, HRMS already has several solutions (Workday, Ultipro, Kronos etc.). Certain industries (e.g. construction management, supply chain etc.) require domain experience to find problems.

## Reading/Learning
There are a few competitors in this area (Moodle, TalentLMS, Litmos etc.) The following resources were used when researching this topic:

## Solutions
The problem, which was to find a paint point, was solved by choosing an LMS system.

## New ideas
Although user management, video/text-based course and quiz options will be prioritized, customizations are likely to be added in later versions.
