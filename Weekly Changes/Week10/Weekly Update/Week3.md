# Weekly Progress Report - Week 3
This week, application environment was setup and development was started.

## Thoughts
React's component-driven architecture has helped break the application down into many different "chunks" 
that are capable of working together. This has also sped up development.

## Struggle/Problems
Given the applcation's dependencies (Java, NodeJS, Tomcat), considerable time was spent in setting up the 
development environment on the given server.

## Reading/Learning
Most of the time this week was spent developing the application.

## Solutions
Although setting up the environment on the provided server was time-consuming, it worked flawlessly once 
all the tools/dependencies were installed.

## New ideas
React-Router will be used to map URLs to different pages of the application.
