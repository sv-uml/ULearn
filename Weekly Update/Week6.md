# Weekly Progress Report - Week 6
This week, some changes were done to the application's routing mechanism.

## Thoughts
Some routes need to be restricted to certain users. For example, logged-in users should not be able to see
the login page.

## Struggle/Problems
There were not any major problems encountered. Since this change is part of user authentication, it was relatively
easy to complete.

## Reading/Learning
No reading was done for this week, since most of the was spent developing the features.

## Solutions
There were not any problems encountered this week.

## New ideas
Apart from application routing, significant time was spent on planning user authentication. At this point, Redux 
appears to be a good option to manage user state throughout the application.
