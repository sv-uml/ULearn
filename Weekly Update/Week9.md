# Weekly Progress Report - Week 9
This week, Heroku builds and automatic deployment was set up.

## Thoughts
Until this week, the application was developed in a local environment. Once the changes were tested, they were pushed to GitHub. However, starting this week, all changes that get pushed to GitHub will automatically be built and deployed to a Heroku server.

## Struggle/Problems
The initial plan was to deploy builds to the Weblab server. However, due to access rights, compatibility between Apache and Node.js and other issues, this could not be completed.

## Reading/Learning
No reading was done this week. StackOverflow was used as reference for some issues.

## Solutions
Since the application could not be deployed on Weblab, Heroku was used for automated deployments. This resulted in continuous deployments as well as release/version management when deploying builds.

## New ideas
No new ideas are planned at this time. Development of planned features (successful authentication, adding new users, adding courses) is being prioritized.
