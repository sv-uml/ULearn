# Weekly Progress Report - Week 5
This week, application development was prioritized. Specifically, user authentication and state management using Redux was worked on.

## Thoughts
React/Redux is powerful, but takes a while to understand and implement. For example, understanding the purpose of actions/reducers/store demanded a lot of time and reading.

## Struggle/Problems
As mentioned in the "Thoughts" section, Redux was difficult to understand and implement. A lot of reading was done to build a basic, functional system that could manage user login. Furthermore, due to various changes in React's core library, several articles were outdated.

## Reading/Learning
The following articles were helpful during the development of user authentication using Redux:
- https://react-redux.js.org/docs/introduction/quick-start
- http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2017/09/16/react-redux-user-registration-and-login-tutorial-example
- https://medium.com/quick-code/adding-authentication-to-react-redux-firebase-app-f0efcb1c519a
- https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/learn-redux-introduction-to-state-management-with-react-b87bc570b12a

Knowledge chunks were extracted from each of these articles to build the final product.

## Solutions
The articles listed in the "Reading/Learning" section were helpful in building a basic version of state management
for the application.

## New ideas
At this time, there are no new ideas for the application. Given the time constraints, most of the effort is being put in completing the existing/planned features. Once these are completed and if there is still time, then additional features/changes will be considered.
