# Weekly Progress Report - Week 10
This week, the application structure was organized into week-specific folders.

## Thoughts
Not enough time could be put into the project this week. The application was re-organized so each week's
changes are put into separate, week-specific folders (Week 9, Week 10 etc.).

## Struggle/Problems
As not enough time could be contributed, there were not any major problems encountered. Organization of week-based folders had to be revised several times.

## Reading/Learning
No reading was done this week. There were multiple revisions of week-based folders.

## Solutions
To account for unforeseen changes, weekly folder structure was re-organized a number of times.

## New ideas
No new ideas are planned at this time. Development of existing features is prioritized.
