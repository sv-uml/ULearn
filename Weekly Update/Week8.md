# Weekly Progress Report - Week 8
This week, user authentication was prioritized. Once Redux/state management was put in place, adjusting application state became easier.

## Thoughts
Redux was implemented last week and paved the way for user authentication. This week, server-side changes were done to allow the user login/logout to their accounts.

## Struggle/Problems
Although no "show-stopping" problems were encountered, it was time-consuming to set up the database and generate authentication token for the user. Spring's JDBC connection setup also took longer than expected.

## Reading/Learning
No reading was done this week. Server-side changes were prioritized.

## Solutions
Although it was time-consuming to make user authentication-related changes on the server-side, the desired result was ultimately achieved. Due to prior knowledge of authentication tokens, it was not difficult to maintain user state.

## New ideas
At this time, there are no new ideas for the application. Significant development is required to complete planned features. Once these features are complete, it will be easier to add/modify features.
