# Weekly Progress Report - Week 2
Last week, Learning Management System (LMS) was picked as pain point to solve. This week was spent researching
what features are covered by other applications and what could be improved.

## Thoughts
ReactJS and TypeScript were chosen as front-end tools to help build a simple, yet powerful user-facing client.
Java/Tomcat/Spring were chosen as backend tools. These are mature technologies and have strong community support.

## Struggle/Problems
The only problem encountered was prioritizing features. Given time constraints, it was difficult to differentiate
between "must-have" and "nice-to-have" features. Minor technical problems (e.g. weblab setup) were encountered.

## Reading/Learning
Most of the reading/learning happened to find problems with current Learning Management Systems. For example,
the following website helped prioritize what areas to focus on:

## Solutions
The website listed in "Reading/Learning" section helped determine what features were "must-haves" and were required in the application.

## New ideas
Redux will be used to manage application state on the front-end client.
